terminal: [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot)

shell: bash

wm: [sway](https://swaywm.org/)

bar: [yambar](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/yambar)


`get_config.sh` is a shell script to put my configs in this repo but I may switch to [Drew Devault's method](https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html) later though.
